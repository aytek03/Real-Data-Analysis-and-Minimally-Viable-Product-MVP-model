# Real Data Analysis and Minimally Viable Product (MVP) model

1) Conduct exploratory data analysis of the Training Set. Provide an overview of the data set and underlying patterns you may identify. Without a thorough data dictionary, you may have to make some assumptions about the data. Document any transformations you perform.

2) Attempt to build an MVP model that predicts the outcome of a restaurant’s next inspection, using NEXT_INSPECTION_GRADE_C_OR_BELOW as the response – General restaurant information and data from the restaurant’s most recent inspection has been provided. Use your knowledge of the data and your own statistical expertise to determine if an MVP model can be built using the available data. Document your thought process, the model techniques you considered, and your recommendation about whether a workable model can be built.

3) Apply your model to the test set – Predict NEXT_INSPECTION_GRADE_C_OR_BELOW for the data in the TEST_SET_2021.csv file.

4) Provide recommendations for how you would enhance the data set to improve the predictive power of the model – Assume “the sky’s the limit” and write a one-page recommendation on how the data set could be improved. Provide at least 8-10 additional attributes and prepare to defend your choices. (It may be helpful to perform additional research online as time allows).
